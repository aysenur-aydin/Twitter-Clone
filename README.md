# Twimba(Twitter-Clone)
<b>The Twimba project's aim is to render tweets and replies from hardcoded data.</b>

In this project, I accomplished new methods and concepts. Here is a list of them:

* `<textarea>` HTML element
  * Used for multi-line text input
* `.forEach()` array method
  * Allows to iterate each element in an array
* `data-...` attributes
  * Used to store information inside the elements and enable identifying which tweet or icon belongs to them
* conditionally render styles
  * When a tweet is liked or retweeted, a class will be added to change the CSS style under the control of a boolean condition
* NOT operator (!)
  * Used for flip a boolean value
* CDNs (Content Delivery Network)
  * add icons from Font Awesome
    * For better user experience
  * generate UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifier)
    * Used for generate random uuids for new tweets

## Strech Goals
There are some strech goals for improvement for this project:
1.  Add the ability to reply to a specific tweet :white_large_square: * <!-- when checkhed :white_check_mark: -->
2. Save tweets, likes and retweets to localStorage :white_large_square: 
3. Allow a user to delete a tweet :white_large_square:

and customize it your own way.

*Checkboxes will be checked once a task has been completed.
